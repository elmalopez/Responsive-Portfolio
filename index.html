            <p> I have been doing Graphic Design for the last 18 years (wow â€“ it's been thant long?) Even being a seasoned artist,
                I still learn something new almost every day. I can't say I don't enjoy doing what I do, I just want to learn
                more. So far I am really digging the Terminal. That's one of the things I probably feared the most. I enjoy
                trouble shooting. Working in print, there's something that always goes wonky. I like to think of new ways
                of doing something that will make my job more efficient, for example automating. I am looking forward to
                learning Javascript. I would like to create my own scripts and plug-ins for tasks I do everyday.
